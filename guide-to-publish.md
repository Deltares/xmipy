# How to publish to PyPi

1) If present remove build and dist folder

2) Recursively remove all .egg-info files
On powershell you can do this with
```
rm -r *.egg-info
```

3) If not done yet, install twine via
```
pip install twine
```
4) Update the version number in the setup.py file.

5) Re-create the wheels:
```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
6) Re-upload the new files:
```
twine upload dist/*
```
