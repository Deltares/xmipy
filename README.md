`xmipy` is an extension to [bmipy](https://pypi.org/project/bmipy/) including an implementation of the abstract methods.
The extended interface is required to couple certain hydrological kernels.
The [imod_coupler](https://github.com/Deltares/imod_coupler) uses it to couple Modflow and Metaswap.

`xmipy` can be installed by running
```
pip install xmipy
```
